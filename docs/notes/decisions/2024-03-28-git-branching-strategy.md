# Git Branching Strategy Decision

## Context
Need to establish a clear branching strategy for development workflow that supports both individual development sessions and official releases.

## Details
The project will follow a feature branch workflow with the following characteristics:

- Developers work on personal branches named after themselves during active development sessions
- These branches are merged back to `main` when development is complete
- Pull requests are required for merging changes after official releases
- The `main` branch represents the stable, production-ready state of the project

## Decisions
1. Personal development branches will be used for longer development sessions
2. Direct merges to main are allowed for development work
3. Pull requests are required after official releases
4. Branch naming convention:
   - Personal branches: `<developer-name>`
   - Release branches: `release/<version>`

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update README.md with branching strategy
- [ ] Create branch protection rules for `main` after releases
- [ ] Document PR review process
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline to support this workflow
