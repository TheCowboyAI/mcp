# Transport and Inspector Implementation Decision

## Context
Need to implement the core transport and inspector functionality for the MCP server, focusing on proper documentation, error handling, and modular design.

## Details
The implementation includes:

1. Transport Layer:
   - StdioTransport implementation for command-line interface
   - Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
   - Proper documentation following Rust best practices
   - Message broadcasting support

2. Inspector Modules:
   - Core system analysis capabilities
   - Flake inspection functionality
   - Environment management
   - Configuration validation
   - Dependency graph generation

3. Project Structure:
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Public API exposed through lib.rs
   - Integration with MCP SDK
   - Proper error propagation

## Decisions
1. Use StdioTransport as primary transport layer
2. Implement comprehensive system analysis features
3. Add support for flake graph generation
4. Structure inspector as modular components
5. Follow Rust documentation best practices
6. Use broadcast channels for message distribution

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement remaining inspector functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Complete environment manager implementation
- [ ] Add configuration validator logic
- [ ] Enhance flake analysis capabilities
