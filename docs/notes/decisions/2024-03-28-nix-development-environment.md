# Nix Development Environment Setup Decision

## Context
Need to establish a proper Nix development environment that supports building, compiling, and running our Rust-based MCP server. This requires both a `flake.nix` for reproducible builds and a development shell configuration.

## Details
The development environment requires:

1. `flake.nix` at project root:
   - Must support `nix build` command
   - Must support `nix run` command
   - Needs to define all dependencies
   - Must include Rust toolchain

2. `modules/devshell.nix`:
   - Rust development environment
   - Build tools and dependencies
   - Development utilities
   - Required for compilation and running

## Decisions
1. Create separate module for development shell configuration
2. Use Rust toolchain from Nixpkgs
3. Implement both `nix build` and `nix run` functionality
4. Keep development dependencies separate from runtime dependencies

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create initial `flake.nix`
- [ ] Create `modules/devshell.nix`
- [ ] Define Rust development environment
- [ ] Test build and run commands
- [ ] Document usage in README

## References
- Relates to project build system
- Will be referenced in development documentation
- Required for CI/CD pipeline
